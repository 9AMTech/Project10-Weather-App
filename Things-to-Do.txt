I'm planning on using the practice APIs from last lesson
    to create the skybox,depending on what weather condition is searched up, it will get a similar gif using ideally a search term they have.
        - Banking on the idea that they have the words like rainy/sunny
            from the weather API, then using that to look up relative
            gifs on giphy
