## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript, LocalStorage, Webpack

This weather app is primarily to show my ability of learning how to use APIs and using asynchronous code. We are pulling
data from the OpenWeather API, and based on what weather condition keywords are also being pulled, we forward that data 
into the Giphy API to pull up a relevant image on the top of the screen.

## Lessons Learned:

- Asynchronous code can be used to simulate what it's like to work with APIs if you don't have access to one.
- How to parse different styles of docs for information.
- How to work with API Keys.
